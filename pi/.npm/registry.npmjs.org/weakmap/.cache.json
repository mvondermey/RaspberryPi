In a WeakMap, the only reference created is key -> value, so it's possible for a key/value in a WeakMap to be garbage collected while the WeakMap they're in still exists! Compare this to an Array, where all items in the Array will not be garbage collected as long as the Array isn't. This forces either explicit management of  object lifespans or, more commonly, simply results in memory leaks.\n\nFor example, data stored using jQuery.data can never be garbage collected unless explicitly nulled out, because it is stored in a container that strongly references the items held inside. Using a WeakMap, it's possible to associate data with an element and have the data destroyed when the element is -- without memory leaking the element; i.e. `weakmap.set(element, { myData: 'gc safe!' })`. jQuery.data (every library has similar functionality) prevents the *element* from memory leaking by using a numeric id, but this does nothing for the __data__ that is stored.\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\n// reusable storage creator\nfunction createStorage(){\n  var store = new WeakMap;\n  return function(o){\n    var v = store.get(o);\n    if (!v) store.set(o, v = {});\n    return v;\n  };\n}\n\n// allows private/namespaced properties for the objects\nvar _ = createStorage();\n\nfunctioon Wrapper(element){\n  var _element = _(element);\n  if (_element.wrapper)\n    return _element.wrapper;\n\n  _element.wrapper = this;\n  _(this).element = element;\n}\n\nWrapper.prototype = {\n  get classes(){\n    return [].slice.call(_(this).element.classList);\n  },\n  set classes(v){\n    _(this).element.className = [].concat(v).join(' ');\n  }\n};\n```\n\n\n## API Reference\n\n* WeakMaps may be inherited from. Initialize objects via `WeakMap.call(obj)`.\n\n### WeakMap\n\n__Non-primitives__ are valid keys.

WeakMap is by far the most useful new addition. If you only need to use objects as keys then uou can use this much more compact library that doesn't have to implement three other classes.\n\n## Compatability\n\nWorks with IE9+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, untested in Opera.\n\n## Install/Use\n\nIf using node, install via:\n\n    npm install weakmap\n\nIn the browser, include __weakmap.js__ or ____weakmap.min.js__ and WeakMap will be exposed on the window.\n\n## Overview\n\nWeakMaps provide a new core weapon to your JS arsenal: objects as keys. This allows you to do the following awesome things: store private data \"on\" public objects, private properties, secretly \"tag\" objects, namespace properties, access controlled properties, check object uniqueness in `O(1)` time complexity.\n\n### WeakMap Garbage Collection Semantics\n\nA benefit of using WeakMaps is enhanced garbage collection. In a WeakMap, the only reference created is key -> value, so it's possible for a key/value in a WeakMap to be garbage collected while the WeakMap they're in still exists!
